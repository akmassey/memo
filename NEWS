1.2: 2014-10-30
	Bugfix version 1.2 released.

	This is an important fix and everyone must updagrade.
	Memo assumed that the is is always one char long. This caused
	a problem where note status could not be changed if the id was
	> 9.

	Thanks for Mikael Berthe for noticing this bug.

1.1: 2014-10-29
        Stable version 1.1 released.

	Notes can be now marked as postponed. See man page
        for more information.

        Memo path can be now set using MEMO_PATH environment
        variable. See man page for more information.

        BUGFIX: Prevent Memo from adding empty notes.

1.0: 2014-10-24
	First official release of Memo. File format is now
	stable and documented.

	Different note statuses are now supported. Notes can
	be "undone" or "done". 

	BUGFIX: Fixed a minor memory leak in main().

0.9: 2014-10-20
	It's now possible to change the path where Memo stores
	notes. See manpage for more information.

	Some refactoring of the codebase was also made. Couple
	of minor bugfixes were made, Memo should be now even
	more stable.	

0.8: 2014-10-19
	Notes can be now searched with regular expressions. 
        POSIX.2 basic regular expressions are supported. This was 
        chosen to achieve compatibility with tools such as grep and sed.

	Added manual page memo(1)

0.7: 2014-10-15
        It's now possible to add a note with custom date. For example
	one could do memo -a "Text for the short note" 2014-24-12. If date
	is omitted, current date will be used.

0.6: 2014-10-11
	Initial release. Memo was originally implemented in Java,
	but that was an ugly hack. Version 0.6 is now rewritten in C99
	and has proper support for reading from stdin among other things.

     2014-10-12
        Added "delete all" option. Also fixed unnecessary errors when ~/.memo
        does not exist.

        Applied patches from Jari Aalto. Includes code readability fixes as
        well as improves help.
